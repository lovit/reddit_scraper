In particular, its 16 GB of memory and super fast memory speed seem to be perfect for training on large data sets and it unmatched by NVidia at the $799 price point. But is it possible to use this GPU to accelerate TensorFlow training and/or inference? I am aware that there is some AMD support for TensorFlow but how good is it, especially for the upcoming version 2.0? Are there other frameworks with better support for AMD?",
