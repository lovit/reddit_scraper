Another difference is that while fashion trends come and go, and what constitute a shirt may be different a hundred years from now, Kuzushiji will always remain Kuzushiji.

I'll try to give some reasons below:\n\n1. MNIST is increasingly becoming outdated as a baseline dataset.\n2. FashionMNIST is built as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, being similar in both dataset size and image size.\n3. FashionMNIST is significantly harder to  classify.\n4. There seems to be no one central resource for finding out what is the state-of-the art\n\nReference links: \n\n1.
