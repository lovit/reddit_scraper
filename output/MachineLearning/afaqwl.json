I have a Windows desktop with a GTX 1060 6GB, and I have a 2014 Macbook Air with a thunderbolt connection. My friend is selling a GTX 1070 8GB for really cheap. It'd be nice if I could use it as an eGPU to run experiments from my desktop or laptop. My main concerns are 1) is thunderbolt fast enough? and 2) would it be cheaper to run it in the cloud somewhere?\n\nI like the peace of mind of owning the setup, and my budget is a few hundred dollars.
