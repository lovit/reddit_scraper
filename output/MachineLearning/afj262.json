  "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to explore research efforts in the area of Telecom industry (Network Management, Network Design and Optimization, Network Managed Services, IoT connectivity, Orchestration, 4G, 5G, Automated Network Operations, Cellular IoT, ) and I would like to know if you can list some conferences or research labs (academic or industrial) that focus on the use of deep learning/GANs to optimize their solutions. Most of the work I have seen uses (traditional) ML techniques and statistical methods to tackle the above-mentioned problems.\n\nIn case you comes across a good survey, please share it. It would be much appreciated. I feel that this community scattered. I worked in NLP before (internships), and it was very easy to see how the community is focused.\n\nThanks in advance.",
